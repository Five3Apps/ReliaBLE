# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to AI Agents (Claude Code, Codex, Grok Build, OpenCode, etc.) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository layout

Two related projects share this repo:

- **ReliaBLE library** (this directory) — Swift Package at `Package.swift` / `Sources/` / `Tests/`. swift-tools-version 6.1, iOS 18+ / macOS 10.15+, builds under **Swift 6 with complete concurrency checking**. This is the supported, shipped product.
- **Demo app** — `Demo/ReliaBLE Demo/`, consumes the library locally. Has its own `Demo/CLAUDE.md` with different conventions (looser concurrency, exploratory code). Treat it as a separate project — don't carry its patterns back into the library.

Open `ReliaBLE.xcworkspace` at the root to work on both together.

### Working on the Demo app

The Demo is a **separate project** with its own conventions and build tooling, kept out of the library's context on purpose:

- Before performing ANY Demo build/run/test task, **read `Demo/CLAUDE.md` first** — it documents the Demo's conventions and its required build tooling (XcodeBuildMCP, not raw `xcodebuild`).
- For substantial Demo work, **delegate to a sub-agent** and instruct it to read `Demo/CLAUDE.md` first. This keeps Demo conventions in an isolated context so they don't pollute the main library session. (A sub-agent does not auto-load `Demo/CLAUDE.md` — tell it to read that file explicitly.)
- Do not carry Demo patterns back into the library.

## Build, test

```sh
swift build                                          # build all targets
swift test                                           # run ReliaBLETests
swift test --filter ReliaBLETests.correctFunction    # single test
```

## Architecture

### Three-target SPM trick for CoreBluetooth mocking

The package declares **three targets** that share a single source tree to make `CoreBluetooth` mockable in tests without polluting the production binary:

- `ReliaBLE` — production target. Uses real `CoreBluetooth`. Includes `Sources/ReliaBLE/CBCentralManagerFactory.swift`, a thin enum that returns a real `CBCentralManager`.
- `ReliaBLEMock` — same sources as `ReliaBLE`, but **excludes** `CBCentralManagerFactory.swift` and the DocC catalog, and links `CoreBluetoothMock` (Nordic Semi). In `Sources/ReliaBLEMock/CoreBluetoothMockAliases.swift`, public typealiases rebind `CBCentralManager`, `CBPeripheral`, `CBCentralManagerFactory`, etc. to their `CBM*` mock counterparts.
- `ReliaBLETests` — depends on `ReliaBLEMock` (not `ReliaBLE`).

**Consequence:** the library code only ever calls `CBCentralManagerFactory.instance(...)`, never `CBCentralManager(...)` directly. The factory's identity is swapped at compile time per target. When editing core BLE code, keep this constraint — `import CoreBluetooth` is fine, but instantiate the central via the factory.

### Swift Concurrency

The library is built with Swift 6 and **complete concurrency checking**. The `ReliaBLEManager` public API should be callable from `@MainActor`, but the library itself should avoid `@MainActor` and instead serialize all Bluetooth interactions on `BluetoothActor` (a plain `actor` defined in `BluetoothActor.swift`). This keeps the library thread-safe and allows the integrating app to decide how to bridge to the main thread for UI updates.

`BluetoothActor` is **not** a `@globalActor` and has no shared singleton. Each `ReliaBLEManager` **owns its own** `BluetoothActor` instance, created synchronously in the manager's `init` (`BluetoothActor(log:reconnectPolicy:restoreIdentifier:)`). There is no `@BluetoothActor` annotation, no `.shared`, and no process-wide state — do not reintroduce any of these.

**One stack per manager.** Each `ReliaBLEManager` is a fully isolated stack: its own actor, `CBCentralManager`, discovered-peripheral snapshots, connection state, and streams. Constructing a second manager yields a second, independent stack — config (logging, `reconnectPolicy`) applies per manager, not first-wins. Two things are *not* isolated and must be kept in mind:

- **Authorization is process-global.** `CBCentralManager.authorization` is app-wide, so one manager's `authorizeBluetooth()` affects every other stack in the process.
- **The radio is shared.** Multiple concurrent aggressive scans degrade each other.

**Restore identifiers.** A `ReliaBLEConfig/restoreIdentifier` must be **unique among simultaneously-live managers** (two live managers sharing an id contend for the same reconnect-intent `UserDefaults` key and CoreBluetooth's per-id restoration domain — unsupported), but the **same id must be reused across launches** for state restoration to work. A live subscriber stream retains its stack until the stream terminates, so a stack does not deinit while anyone is still subscribed.

### Logging

`LoggingService` wraps Willow's `Logger` with an async execution queue. The service is `Sendable` and passed by reference into both managers. Default writer is an `OSLogWriter` (`subsystem: com.five3apps.relia-ble`, `category: BLE`), configurable via `ReliaBLEConfig`. Logging is **disabled by default** — `config.loggingEnabled` must be set to true. Log calls take a `tags: [LogTag]` array; use `.category(.scanning)`, `.peripheral(id)`, etc. rather than embedding the category in the message.

### Authorization flow

`ReliaBLEManager.init` does **not** instantiate `CBCentralManager` unless the user has already granted `.allowedAlways`. This is deliberate so the integrating app controls when the iOS permission prompt appears — callers invoke `authorizeBluetooth()` when they want the prompt. Preserve this lazy-init behavior when touching `BluetoothActor.setupCentralManager()`.

## Notes for editing

- **This library is in pre-release development stage.** Breaking changes are expected. Do not reference behavior history in any library documentation or code comments (noting in planning docs is acceptable and expected). Do not waste time thinking about mitigating breaking changes. Focus on the current design and implementation.
- Public API on `ReliaBLEManager` is the supported surface for external consumers. Adding/removing methods there is a breaking change.
- `forceMock: true` is currently passed to `CBCentralManagerFactory.instance(...)` in `BluetoothActor`. The production factory ignores this parameter; the mock factory honors it. Don't "clean it up" — it's load-bearing for the test target.
- DocC catalog lives at `Sources/ReliaBLE/Documentation.docc/`. The `swift-docc-plugin` is a package dep so `swift package generate-documentation` works. This documentation **must** be kept up to date with the public API on `ReliaBLEManager` and the overall architecture and usage patterns.
